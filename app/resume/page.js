My strengths lie in designing .NET and web standard solutions that solve real users’ problems, with a collaborative communication style with end users and/or product owners. I also enjoy finding ways to make development teams more productive and OOP- and TDD-focused. I strongly prefer remote work but also value in-person working sessions when it justifies the commute time.</p>
